# playground
This app is my playground. The intention is to be able to use a strong, simple, and modular foundation to test out any sort of technologies / libraries.
I'll use this app to hone my skills, and maybe make something cool in the process.\n
This app launches other smaller module apps which act almost completely independently, I'm working on getting the 'almost' out of there. Each one of these
modules will focus on a certain skill. This app is and will always be a work in progress as it reflects my experience as an Android engineer.
