# playground
This app is my playground. The intention is to be able to use a strong, simple, and modular foundation to test out any sort of technologies / libraries.
I'll use this app to hone my skills, and maybe make something cool in the process.


This app is nested with smaller module apps which act <i>almost</i> completely independently, I'm working on getting the '<i>almost</i>' out of there. Each one of these
modules will focus on a certain skill.

I'm in no rush with this and will probably leave it more or less untouched once school starts. It'll serve as a good reference to ramp up on Android development when the time comes. 

<b> This app is and will always be a work in progress as it reflects my experience as an Android engineer.</b>
